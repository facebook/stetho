 * **Add UI Accessibility Properties to Styles tab**
   Added support for accessibility inspection, which allows users to select
   a View and see whether or not it will be focusable by an Accessibility
   Service, why it will or won't be focusable, the text description sent to
   Accessibility Services, and any AccessibilityActions that are currently
   available on the View.

## Version 1.3.1

_2016-02-25_

   Several performance, correctness, and stability improvements related to
   how Stetho performs tree diffing.

 * Fix #349: Fix dumpapp scripts under various edge cases.

## Version 1.3.0

_2016-01-20_

 * **okhttp3 support!**
   A new module, stetho-okhttp3, has been added which supports the new
   okhttp3 APIs.  Note that stetho-okhttp is now deprecated.

 * **Removed Apache HttpClient dependency**
   A new, lightweight HTTP server implementation replaces it in Stetho
   and the dumpapp protocol has been modified to no longer use HTTP.
   Old dumpapp scripts will still work with new clients, however the
   opposite will hang!

 * **Custom database drivers**
   Completely custom or ContentProvider-based database drivers are available
   which allow greater inspection options with some configuration.  See
   `DefaultInspectorModulesBuilder#provideDatabaseDriver`.

 * New #282: Show view margins in "Styles" subtab.
 * New #289: Show SQLite views as tables.
 * New #294: dumpapp now responds to `STETHO_PROCESS` env variable in addition
   to the `--process` flag.
 * Fix #286: Minor JsConsole improvements.
 * Fix #297: Sort CSS properties by name.
 * Fix #292: Minor JSON serialization fixes.
 * Fix #299: Memory leak fixes in view inspection (still some likely remain).
 * Fix #305: Add proguard rules to stetho-js-rhino aar artifact.
 * Fix #313: Work around issues formatting `Long.MIN_VALUE` and possibly others
   when showing in the database view.
 * Fix #332: NPE in ShadowDocument.getGarbageElements().

## Version 1.2.0

_2015-09-11_

 * **View properties support!**
   The "Styles" and "Computed" sub-tabs in "Elements" are now implemented,
   complete with the box model diagram and a summary of the most useful view
   properties.

 * **Screencasting**
   Click the small screen icon in the upper right to view a live preview of
   your phone's screen while using Stetho!  Coming soon: mouse/keyboard
   support.

 * **Console tab support**
   Arbitrary Java/JavaScript support added to the Console with the optional
   `stetho-js-rhino` dependency.  See
   [`stetho-sample/build.gradle`](stetho-sample/build.gradle) for details.

 * **New simpler initialization and customization API**
   Most callers can now just use `Stetho.initializeWithDefaults(context)`.
